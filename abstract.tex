% ABSTRACT
By using traditional DNS rebinding attacks, an attacker is able to circumvent firewalls in order to access internal network servers. Although many of the variations of this attack are well-known and sufficiently defended against, we plan to show that by exploiting browsers' DNS cache table, it is still possible to launch a DNS rebinding attack on modern browsers. Furthermore, we plan to build FireDrill, a tool that uses this new method to intialize an interactive session between the attacker and victim's web server.
