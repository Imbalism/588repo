\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

We plan to evaluate our attack method against other DNS rebinding approaches. We hope to measure two primary factors. We plan to analyze the \emph{time to complete} of the attack and the \emph{impact} of the attack. We suspect, for example, that a multiple A record attack will finish quickly but have limited impact due to how browsers handle it. On the other hand, a time-varying attack that establishes an interactive session could take more time to complete, but could do be much more damaging. While the \emph{time to complete} will be a quantitative metric, we suspect that \emph{impact} will be a more abstract, qualitative result.
